    excerpt: "After analyzing 500+ SaaS sales placements, we discovered why sending 4 quality candidates outperforms the industry standard of 20+ CVs.",
    content: `The traditional recruitment model is broken. Here's the math that proves it.

## The Problem with Volume-Based Recruitment

Most agencies operate on a spray-and-pray model:
- Send 20-30 CVs per role
- Hope something sticks
- Low success rates (15-25%)
- Waste everyone's time

## Our 'Score in Four' Data

After tracking 500+ placements over 3 years:
- Average candidates presented: 3.2 per role
- Success rate: 89% (vs. industry 23%)
- Time to hire: 3.1 weeks (vs. industry 12+ weeks)
- Client satisfaction: 96% (vs. industry 67%)

## Why Quality Beats Quantity

**1. Pre-screening Excellence**
We spend 40+ hours per role on market research and candidate qualification before presenting anyone.

**2. Cultural Fit Analysis**
Every candidate is assessed for company culture alignment, not just technical skills.

**3. Compensation Alignment**
We ensure salary expectations match before any introduction.

**4. Reference Verification**
All candidates come with verified track records and references.

## The Real Cost of Bad Hires

- Average bad hire cost: €240,000
- Time lost to re-recruiting: 6-8 months
- Team morale impact: Immeasurable

## Conclusion

When you're hiring for revenue-critical roles, precision beats volume every time. That's why we guarantee maximum 4 candidates per role - because the right hire is worth more than 20 wrong ones.`,
